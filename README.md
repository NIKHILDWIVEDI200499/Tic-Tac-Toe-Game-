The Tic Tac Toe game is a simple and interactive web-based application created using front-end technologies — HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is a two-player game where players take turns marking X or O in a 3x3 grid. The goal is to place three marks in a row — horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
(1) HTML (HyperText Markup Language):
Used to create the basic structure of the game board, including the 3x3 grid and buttons.

(2) CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):
Provides styling to the game board, cells, and buttons. It makes the interface visually appealing with layouts, colors, fonts, hover effects, and transitions.

(3) JavaScript:
It adds the interactivity and game logic:
Alternates turns between Player X and Player O.
Detects win conditions and draw.
Displays a winning message or draw notification.
Resets the game with a single click.
